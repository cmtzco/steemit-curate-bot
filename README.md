# Multivote Bot
This bot allows for multiple accounts to upvote your steem posts.  This code is ever evolving based on the needs of the upvote demands and the rewards algorithm.  Feel free to do pull requests and comment on any improvements.  I am always learning and would love any input on stuff that could be improved.
